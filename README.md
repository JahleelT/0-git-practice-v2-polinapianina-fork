Hello everyone! Here's the article that I have picked for this exercise: 

[How to tell what level of developer you are, junior to senior](https://jg.gg/2020/11/22/how-to-tell-what-level-of-developer-you-are/?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43--------------------------------)

As a senior in college preparing to enter the workforce, I found Jackson Gabbard's article insightful, for I think it's precectly clear at separating these three levels of developers. The idea that career progression in tech is *meritocratic* resonates with me, particularly as it contrasts with the rigid hierarchies seen in other industries, according to the author of the article. The emphasis on continual learning and skill-building, rather than years of experience, is both motivating and reassuring as I prepare to begin my career.
